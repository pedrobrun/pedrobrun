### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as a **Full Stack Mobile Developer**.

These are some of the **technologies I'm working with right now**: 
* C# (.NET Core / .NET 5)
* Flutter / Dart
* Linux
* PostgreSQL
                                                               
I'm always happy to discover and study other areas, languages and tools.
Specifically interested in studying and working with **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Science** in the future.
